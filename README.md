# Horiseon-Refactor

______________________

## Description

______________

This project is a code refactor for the Horiseon website home page. The objective behind this project is to rework the pre-composed code to be more accessible, legible and efficient. The changes made to the code do not effect the visual presentation of the website's home page.

### Changes Made
